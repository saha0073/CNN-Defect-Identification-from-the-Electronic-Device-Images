## Introduction

In this project, we consider the problem of using supervised machine learning algorithms, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNN), for detect detection in the electronic device images. Our objective is to identify the type of defects from device that are fed to our algorithms as either containing or not containing defects, and thereby, compare the efficiency of these models for the task of semantic segmentation. We consider aerial images restricted to a size of 101x101 pixels with 3 color channels, containing either one or more solar panels each of varying sizes and shapes. Such an approach to identifying solar panels in aerial images can have important applications in a variety of sectors, preeminent among which is its potential to help estimate the scale prevalence of solar power consumption in the US.
